# 🧪 Rust By Example

Learning Rust through practical, runnable examples — a code-first companion to The Rust Book.

## 📖 Description

Rust By Example (RBE) teaches Rust through executable code examples. This folder contains my implementations, experiments, and insights as I work through each concept hands-on.

**Focus**: Writing code, experimenting with variations, and reinforcing concepts from The Rust Book.

## 🔗 How I'm Using This

1. **After reading a chapter in The Book** → Find related RBE examples
2. **Type out the code** (no copy-paste) → Understand by doing
3. **Modify and experiment** → Break it, fix it, extend it
4. **Note only "aha moments"** → Keep it lightweight
